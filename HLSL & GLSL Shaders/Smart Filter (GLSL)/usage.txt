Shader:
	Vertex Program: SmartFilter.vp.glsl
		Inputs: None
		Outputs: None
	Fragment Program: SmartFilter.fp.glsl
		Inputs:
			sampler2D	diffuseMap	Base Color Image to put onto the Mesh/Model
			sampler2D	stateMap	Preprocessed Image to calculate tween-texels from
			boolean		enabled		Enable or Disable SmartFilter(Debugging)
			float		mixStep		Set the mixture of bilinear and smart filtering. A value of 2/3 looks good.
		Outputs: none
	Apply shaders to: Mesh/Model
	Sideeffects:
		Slight Texture artifacts
		Requires twice as much GPU ram right now.

sfltproc.exe
	Use this to get the stateMap out of a diffuseMap. Use it like this:
	sfltproc.exe -i "INPUTIMAGE" -o "OUTPUTIMAGE" -b Threshold(0-255)
	It also has a help parameter, -h
