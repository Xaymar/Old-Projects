Smart Filter (GLSL)
=======================

A GLSL and BlitzMax implementation of the Smart Filter method that makes textures incredibly crisp, at the cost of some instructions and an extra sampler. Works great, requires some tweaking though. This could potentially be moved to the shader completely, saving a sampler, but increasing samples and instructions. Only worth it for signs that have text on them, as it kind of preserves the sharpness of the text.
