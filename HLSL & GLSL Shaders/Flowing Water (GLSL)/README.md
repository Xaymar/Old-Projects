Flowing Water (GLSL)
=======================

My attempt at creating a repeating flowing water pattern that is slower in some areas and faster in others using a flow map. Differences in speed are kind of hard to clear up to fading back to the original value after some time was said to be the solution. No idea if this still works, RenderMonkey doesn't start on my system anymore.
