Sirius Online Launcher
=======================

Originally supposed to be the official launcher, it was later dumped as contact died off to the lead developer due to him going from 100mbit to potato quality internet. He didn't like the idea that it would check for an update and download it, instead of letting you play directly. Neither did he like the way the updates were handled, hash based checking for new files seemed to not go over well to him.
The project contains some things from the forums for BlitzMax, as well as my try at adding some extra support to Max2D. Remember Blitz3D? The 2D system in BlitzMax is basically the same, except worse.
