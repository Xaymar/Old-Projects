xaymar.datapak
=======================

A newer iteration of DataCollector, named DataPaks. It was inspired by Minecraft's NBT format and as such has similar features. It supports many types, as well as arrays of such types (in case you don't want to name each entry, useful for inventories). Saved and loaded archives can be passworded and compressed, it is up to you to use that feature. The project includes two examples, which just show how to use the module.
