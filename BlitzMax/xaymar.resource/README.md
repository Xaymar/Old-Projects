xaymar.resource
=======================

I created this back when multi-threading was highly praised for the features it could give you. This allows you to load anything asynchronous and still know how far the loading process is. Easily extendable as it was designed to work flawlessly with as many types as possible. Requires threading, otherwise it will just be synchronous.
Supports both basic BRL modules as well as xaymar.datapak, which allows you to load large files without the program hanging up for a while. Thank god for threading!
