xaymar.config
=======================

An easy way to load configurations from so called 'DataPaks'. DataPaks were inspired by Minecraft's NBT format and were able to store any arbitrary data. It's still more efficient to have a dedicated format instead of DataPaks, but it helps with compatability across versions. As far as I remember, this is thread-safe.
