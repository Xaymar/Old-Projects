# Old Projects #

Ah, the good old days of having time to actually do this, instead of working your ass off every single hour of the day. Here are all the projects that still exist(ed) in some form on my HDD or other storage device. Check the README.md in each directory to read more about the specific project.

These projects are no longer supported and will not be continued, so use at your own risk. Submitting patches using pull requests is fine by me, I check them every day.
