Impostor
=======================

You know those distant objects that don't quite seem like a 3D object, but still turn with the view? That's an impostor, and this was supposed to be a Blitz3D implementation of that. Didn't work out as planned though, so here's the broken version that used FastExt to do its work.
If you don't know where to get FastExt, google will help you.
