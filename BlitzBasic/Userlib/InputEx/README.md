InputEx
=======================

You know what is great to do? Extend the functionality of a shitty language! This userlibrary adds the ability to use the entire keyboard and mouse buttons, even allowing you to read the time of access, how long it's been active etc. Only downside is that it relies on GetAsyncKeyState.
