Sirius Online Inventory
=======================

This was ment to be in the Sirius Online project, but the lead devloper never got further than complaining. So it has the side-effect of not working.I planned to optimize it to use as little memory and network bandwidth as possible, but the project was abandoned before I could go that far. Right now, it probably doesn't even work.
