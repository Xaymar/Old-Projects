LinkedList Emulation
=======================

Since the early BlitzBasic languages didn't have any kind of lists aside from the global ones, I had to make something out of nothing. This library adds the ability to have linked lists inside of those languages.
It was initially ment to use FastPointer or a similar library, but that failed horrifically, as I wasn't able to cast back into the original type and memory leaks happened. It's somewhat fast, but solutions tailored to a single type still work faster 90% of the time.
